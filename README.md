# Space Image Data Processing and Projects

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on space data images dataset called [Galaxies Center](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsdincer/center-of-all-observable-galaxiesfits-allesa). The notebooks demonstrate how to perform EDA on space images on specific features, using different filters, and visualization libraries to perform Spectroscopy. The aim of this project is to provide researchers and data enthusiasts with a starting point for their own space data image analysis projects.
